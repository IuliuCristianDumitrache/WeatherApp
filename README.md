# Weather ReadMe

WeatherApp provides users with real-time weather information for their current location as well as any other location they choose. Users can create a widget for quick access, save favorite locations, or view them on a map.

## Requirements
- Implement one of the two designs: the Forest design or the Sea design.
- Fetch weather data based on the userâ€™s current location using the following APIs:
  - [OpenWeatherMap Current API](https://openweathermap.org/current)
  - [OpenWeatherMap 5-day Forecast API](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5)
- Change background images dynamically based on weather conditions (Cloudy, Sunny, Rainy).
- Demonstrate best practices including:
  - Architecture
  - Design Patterns
  - Unit Testing (preferentially TDD)
  - Proper use of SOLID principles
  - Integration into a CI/CD build pipeline
  - Code coverage integration
  - Static code analysis
- Additional features:
  - Save favorite locations
  - View list of favorites
  - Get extra information about a specific location using Google Places API
  - View weather information while offline
  - View saved locations on a map

## Design Chosen
The design chosen was the Forest design. The application connects to OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data and utilizes the /current endpoint for current weather and the /forecast5 endpoint for 5-day forecast. It dynamically changes background images to reflect real-time weather conditions.

## Features
- **Favorite Locations:** Users can save and view favorite locations for easy access.
- **Map View:** Users can visualize favorite locations on a map.
- **Search:** Utilizes the Places API to search for weather conditions in any location worldwide.
- **Settings:** Change the unit of measurement from metric to imperial.
- **Offline Support:** Enables viewing weather information while offline, displaying the time of the last update.
- **Widget:** Possibility to add widget on home screen with current location weather condition and quick access to the app / refresh button.

## Architecture
The WeatherApp follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture pattern for better separation of concerns and maintainability. Components include:
- **Model:** Represents data and business logic.
- **View:** Represents UI components and layout.
- **ViewModel:** Acts as a mediator between Model and View, handling UI-related logic.

## Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
Implemented CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions to automate build, test, and deployment processes.

## Unit Testing
Implement CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions to automate build, test, and deployment processes.

There are two actions on GitHub, one to Build Debug APK and one to run Unit Tests.  
You can manually run the Build Debug APK action to generate an artifact.

UnitTest action contains the static code analysis ( Lint ) and test coverage artifacts. This action will run on every push from the main branch or can be manually trigerred.

## Code Coverage Integration
Utilized code coverage tools like JaCoCo to measure code coverage and ensure thorough testing.
